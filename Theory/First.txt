Q1) What is Emmet ?

- Emmet is web-developer's toolkit that can greatly improve your Html and CSS workflow.

- Basically, most text editors allows you to store and re-use commonly used code-chunks. These snippets are good way to increase productivity.

- But these snippets have common pitfalls i.e you have to define snippet first and then use it at runtime.

- Emmet takes this snippets idea to a whole new level. you can type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in abbreviation.
